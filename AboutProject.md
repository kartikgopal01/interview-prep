### Methodology Implementation

1. **Caching System**
   - Implements a time-based cache to reduce redundant AI calls
   - Cache TTL (Time-To-Live): 1 hour for frequently requested content

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - Controls API usage to prevent abuse
   - Window-based rate limiting (20 requests per minute)

3. **Fallback Mechanisms**
   - Default question sets by role and experience level
   - Graceful degradation when rate limits are reached
